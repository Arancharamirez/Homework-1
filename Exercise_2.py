# Write a program that receives two inputs from the terminal (using input()).
# Both inputs need to be an integer. Assign them, respectively to a variable named "n"
# and a variable named "p". The program will 
# compute the product n*nn*nnn*...*nnn...n (where the last number contains p times n) 
# and print it on the screen.
# example 1: n = 5, p = 4, output = 5*55*555*5555 = 152625
# example 2: n = 3, p = 6, output = 3*33*333*3333*33333*333333 = 1.22086e18
