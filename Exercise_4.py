# Write a program that receives two inputs from the terminal (using input()).
# Both inputs need to be integers. Assign them, respectively to a variable named "m"
# and a variable named "n". The program will print on the terminal, the greatest common divisor (GCD)
# of the two numbers.
# Example: n = 10, m = 12, output = 2
